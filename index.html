                    📉 Weren't able to find an internship? Or had an offer
                    rescinded? Unfortunately, you're not alone. 🥲 But what if
                    you could still build something cool this summer? And learn
                    a ton in the process? 🚀📈

                    Meet: <b>Summer of Shipping.</b> Started in 2020, this is a
                    community of <b>makers</b> and <b>mentors</b> who come
                    together to create a sort of "mock internship" experience.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    You'll <b>ship code</b> for a personal project daily, 🚢
                    either alone or in a team. You'll sit in
                    <b>weekly workshops</b> to learn concepts normally covered
                    by an internship, ✏️ and have a chance to
                    <b>demo your work.</b> And all the while, you'll get
                    <b>feedback and support from a community</b> of industry
                    folks and senior students 🫂.
